# Sentiment Analysis Model using LSTM and Keras

This repository contains a Python script for building and training a sentiment analysis model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks with Keras. The model is designed to classify text data into positive and negative sentiment categories.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone behind a piece of text. In this project, we use an LSTM-based neural network to classify text reviews into two sentiment categories: positive and negative.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.7+)
- TensorFlow (2.0+)
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Beautiful Soup (for HTML tag removal)
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- WordCloud
- scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive development)

You can install these dependencies using `pip` or `conda` package manager.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Prepare your dataset:
   - Replace the dataset path in the code with the path to your own dataset CSV file.

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python sentiment.py
   ```

4. Follow the code comments for customization. You can adjust hyperparameters, model architecture, and preprocessing steps as needed for your specific use case.

## Dataset

This code assumes you have a CSV dataset containing text reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels (positive or negative). You should replace the dataset path in the code with your own dataset.

The dataset used in the example code is provided as an example and may not be suitable for your specific task.

## Preprocessing

The code includes a text preprocessing function that performs the following steps:

- Lowercasing: Converts text to lowercase.
- HTML Tag Removal: Uses BeautifulSoup to remove HTML tags from text.
- Special Character Removal: Removes special characters, numbers, and punctuation.
- Tokenization: Splits text into individual words (tokens).
- Stopword Removal: Removes common English stopwords.
- Lemmatization: Reduces words to their base form using lemmatization.

You can customize the preprocessing function based on your data requirements.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of the following layers:

- Embedding Layer: Converts tokenized words into dense vectors (word embeddings).
- LSTM Layer: Processes the sequential data and captures context information.
- Dense Layer: Produces the final output with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

You can adjust the embedding dimension, LSTM units, and other hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.

## Training

The model is trained on the preprocessed text data using the training dataset. You can specify the number of training epochs and batch size according to your requirements.

## Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on a validation dataset, and metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are provided. You can further customize the evaluation metrics based on your needs.
